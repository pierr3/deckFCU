# DeckFCU

An FCU for XPlane

Support for the StreamDeck+ (due to dial usage, can be used elsewhere without dials)
Touch screen is used, try tapping on the dial values (eg, standby com will switch to primary)

Current aircraft support: FF757/767, ToLiss A321

Partial config that needs tweaking: Default XPlane, Zibo737, check out src/disabledConfigs and src/configs if you wish to help map the datarefs
